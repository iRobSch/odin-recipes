            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray 8 cups of a muffin tin with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Finely chop cherry tomatoes and drain any liquid. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Unroll pizza crust on a floured work surface and roll out thinly into a large rectangle. Using a 4-inch round cookie or biscuit cutter, 
                    <br>cut 8 circles in the dough. Place dough circles in the prepared muffin cups, pressing dough into the bottom and up the sides of each cup.</li>
                <li>Drop 1 teaspoon mozzarella into each cup. Top with 1 tablespoon of pizza sauce. Add chopped tomatoes and red onions. Add 1 tablespoon of 
                    <br>mozzarella to each cup, and top with pepperoni. Sprinkle each cup with Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and garlic salt to taste.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbling and melted, 14 to 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool in
                    <br>the tin for about 5 minutes. Remove from the tin and serve hot.</li>
