                <li>2 tablespoons of water</li>

                <li>1 cup of dry white wine <strong>(optional)</strong></li>

            <h4>Directions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Pound the pork chops with a spiked meat mallet until 1/4 inch thick; set aside. In a large bowl, combine the bread crumbs,
                    <br>Parmesan cheese, parsley flakes, salt, and pepper. Press the pork into the crumbs to bread thoroughly; set aside.</li>
                <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. 
                    <br>Pour in the wine and sliced mushrooms. Allow to simmer and cook until the mushrooms have softened, about 10 minutes. 
                    <br>Stir together the cornstarch and water, then add to the mushroom sauce. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, then remove from the heat and set aside.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. 
                    <br>the pork cutlets a few at a time until golden brown and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Serve with reserved mushroom sauce.</li>
